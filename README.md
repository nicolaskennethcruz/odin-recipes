# odin-recipes

This is the first project in The Odin's Project. The objective in this project is to create a BASIC recipe website. Just build a website that is functional on switching pages, no design yet. But, it is indicated in the TOP that we will design this later on. I am expected to perform basic HTML skills to get this project done.
